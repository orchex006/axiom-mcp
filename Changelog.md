# Changelog — axiom-mcp

## Unreleased

- **C-002** Mount a real MCP Streamable HTTP server in FastAPI. Add
  `src/axiom_mcp/sdk_compat.py` (explicit lifespan composition so the SDK session
  manager starts and stops exactly once, re-parenting the SDK's own Streamable HTTP
  handler onto the contract path `/mcp` so the endpoint is an exact match with no
  redirect and nothing is mounted at `/`, an exact-match `LifecycleRecorder`, and a
  real in-process `initialize` handshake that reports the negotiated protocol),
  `tests/test_sdk_mount.py` and `docs/sdk-mount-lifecycle.md`, plus the
  `release/mcp_mount_spike.py` verification artifact. The spike records the failure
  this task exists to prevent: a plain Starlette mount serves HTTP but answers
  `initialize` with HTTP 500 because mounting does not run the sub-application
  lifespan.

- **C-001** Pin the Python runtime and the official MCP SDK. Add `pyproject.toml`
  (`requires-python >=3.13,<3.14`, `mcp==1.28.1` plus exact FastAPI/Uvicorn/Starlette/
  Pydantic/anyio/httpx pins, the `axiom-mcp` console entry point, pytest and ruff
  configuration), `src/axiom_mcp/version.py` (canonical version dimensions and the
  compatibility-spike predicates), `src/axiom_mcp/__init__.py`, `tests/test_runtime_pin.py`
  and `docs/runtime-compatibility.md`. The first implementation in this repository also
  establishes the required check `python -m pytest tests -q` with recorded output and exit
  code, and `.gitignore`/`.gitattributes` for cache exclusion and LF discipline.

- Add `AGENTS.md` and a verified `spec.lock.json`: the pin records the immutable `axiom-specs` revision and seven contract digests, and `tools/spec-lock-check.py` accepts it with exit code 0. Implementation tasks are no longer blocked by the missing governance pin.

- Add `Development.md`: component development contract covering repository identity, preflight gate, required checks, evidence and completion requirements, branch/merge/release policy, and the rule that verified work finished in a worktree must reach the owner's primary checkout.

### Notes

- The runtime pin is enforced, not asserted: `tests/test_runtime_pin.py` compares
  `pyproject.toml`, `axiom_mcp.version` and the installed interpreter/SDK, and a boundary
  test proves a legacy-only SDK surface fails the spike.
- The release gate stays closed. No tag, release branch or publish was created.
